There are no intentional backward incompatible changes since the last release.
We have (hopefully temporarily) switched back to prebuilt kernels for redfin and related devices (bramble and barbet) in the vanilla flavor.
Re-adding support for building these kernels in robotnix will likely require resolving [#116](https://github.com/danielfullmer/robotnix/issues/116).

There are no intentional backward incompatible changes since the last release.

Between commits on Aug 2-3 there was brief period where the robotnix would not correctly include the Update package for the GrapheneOS flavor.
If you have already updated your device with a build produced during this interval, and you don't see "System updates" under "Settings", you can still update your device by sideloading, [instructions here](https://docs.robotnix.org/installation.html#updating-by-sideloading-ota-files).

# 2020-12-08

## Highlights:
 - Updated vanilla flavor to December 2020 release
 - Updated GrapheneOS flavor to December 2020 release
 - Updated lineageos flavor to December 2020 (thanks @Atemu)
 - Added various documentation under docs/ (thanks @hmenke)
 - Added sunfish device to attestation/auditor patches (thanks @hmenke)
 - Added remaining pixel devices to attestation/auditor patches
 - Added basic APK signature verification in Nix for prebuilt APKs (e.g. Microg / Google apks)

## Backward incompatible changes
 - Switched auditor / attestation to use device-specific keys as opposed to device-family keys

The NixOS attestation-server module option has been changed from
`services.attestation-server.deviceFamily` to
`services.attestation-server.device`.

 - Significant changes to key / certificate generation, described below.

We now use new application-specific keys and certificates for included apps
like Chromium / webview, Microg, and F-Droid, instead of relying on the
device-specific `releasekey`.  This allows us to share these keys between
multiple devices, push the same app updates to multiple devices, and remove an
ugly SELinux workaround for GrapheneOS that robotnix required.

Unfortunately, changing app keys may lose any data associated with those apps.
Fortunately, most data associated with those apps should be easy to re-create.
(Re-login to services in chromium, re-add F-Droid repos, etc.)
I hope to avoid potentially breaking changes like this in the future by getting
these changes done relatively early in the projects' life.

If you've previously generated robotnix keys, you will need to do the
following to update to the new key directory layout: Move any keys and
certificates (if they exist) beginning with `com.android` from the device
subdir (e.g.  `crosshatch`) under your `keyStorePath` to the parent directory.
The files beginning with `releasekey`, `platform`, `shared`, `media`,
`networkstack`, and `avb`/`verity` (if you have it) are device-specific, and
should remain under the device subdirectory.  For example, I ran the following
command on my machine:
 ```shell
$ mv /var/secrets/android-keys/crosshatch/com.android.* /var/secrets/android-keys/
 ```
After this, re-run `generateKeysScript` to create new application keys (e.g.
Chromium, F-Droid).
